% Overview
The MPU6050 is a widely used six-axis motion tracking device with an integrated 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer.
It can provide a variety of motion information including acceleration, angular velocity, temperature, etc., and is widely used in flight control, 
motion detection and other fields. The MPU6050 communicates with the microcontroller through an I2C interface and supports a variety of motion processing algorithms.
